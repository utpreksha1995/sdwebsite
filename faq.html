At your desired time we will come to your house/office to get your signature and we will transfer the money right away. If you need funds again in Future and want to take a loan from us, money would reach your account in not more than a few minutes. While applying the first time you will go through these 5 steps:<br>
                                 1) Quickly skim through the mostly prefilled app pages, key in the minimal data left, and upload your bank statements. Quickly rehearse your moves for the night or pack your bags for a hell of a trip. In not more than 10 minutes your loan would be sanctioned.<br>
                                 2) Once sanctioned, Upload KYC documents and selfie on our mobile app. In minutes we will e-mail you your loan agreement and will ask you to confirm a time and place to sign your loan agreement (RBI needs this!).<br>
                                 3) Once you confirm your availability, we will come running to you, within an hour or at the time you choose.<br>
                                 4) Once our officer reaches your house/office, he will check an original ID proof (one that you submitted) and will get your signatures on loan agreement.<br>
                                 5) Sit in your car and start your engine for one of the best moments of your life. We would have transferred the money to your bank account. The money would reach your account according to the time your bank takes!<br>
                                 6) Within few minutes of you signing the agreement, you can transfer the loan to your bank account using our mobile app. Within a minutes money is transferred to your bank account once you initiate the money transfer from our mobile app. 7)We recommend you to use eKYC service of Aadhaar available on App for faster completion of documentation to avail loan.<br>
                                 The whole process should not take more than a Business Days time to complete.

                              <p class="accordion-content">Yes, our lending partners are RBI registered NBFC/Bank, they are obligated to report our Loan, its history, the late payment and non-payment of dues to credit bureaus such as CIBIL and Equifax. This will impact your chances of getting banking products. By paying on time, your score improves and so does your chances of getting a credit card or any loan!!!</p>

In case you change your salary bank account, pls share new salary bank account statement with at least one salary credit at salarydost@rhinofinance.in and we would change the same. You would need to sign new NACH mandate form and once it is registered, we would deduct money from new Salary bank account.</p>
